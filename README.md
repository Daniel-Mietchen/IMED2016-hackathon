# About
This repo contains auxiliary materials for the [IMED 2016 hackathon](http://www.hackathon.isid.org/) that is taking place in Vienna on November 3-5, 2016, as a companion event to the [IMED 2016 conference](http://imed.isid.org/) on November 4-7, 2016, also in Vienna.

# Theme
The hackathon is themed around infectious disease outbreaks and their relation to climate change.

# Data
Several sets of data will be available to hackathon participants during the event, as outlined at [http://www.hackathon.isid.org/resources](http://www.hackathon.isid.org/resources). 

In addition, participants will have the possibility to work with a selection of data resources related to the current Zika virus outbreak, with a strong focus on open data. These resources will be outlined here in this repo in the weeks leading to the hackathon. A very rough draft is available via [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Medicine/Zika#Zika-related_data_sets](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Medicine/Zika#Zika-related_data_sets).

# Models et al.
Besides data, we welcome models as well as analytical and visualization tools that can help to make sense of the data.
