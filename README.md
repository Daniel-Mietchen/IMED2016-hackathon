# About
This repo contains auxiliary materials for the [IMED 2016 hackathon](http://www.hackathon.isid.org/) that is taking place in Vienna on November 3-5, 2016, as a companion event to the [IMED 2016 conference](http://imed.isid.org/) on November 4-7, 2016, also in Vienna. To apply for the hackathon, go [here](http://www.hackathon.isid.org/apply).

# Theme
The hackathon is themed around infectious disease outbreaks and their relation to climate change.

Some background on the topic can be found in the following resources:
* [4 reasons disease outbreaks are erupting around the world](http://www.vox.com/2016/5/31/11638796/why-there-are-more-infectious-disease-outbreaks) (introductory; a "warming climate" is listed as number 4)
* [Climate Change And Infectious Diseases](http://www.who.int/globalchange/environment/en/chapter6.pdf) (introductory)
* [Evolution in action: climate change, biodiversity dynamics and emerging infectious disease](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2013.0553) (intermediate)
* [Climate change and vector-borne diseases of humans](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/370/1665.toc) (advanced)

Within that wider theme, one of the focal areas will be the ongoing [Zika virus outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_Zika_virus_epidemic). Some background on this:
* [Analyzing climate variations at multiple timescales can guide Zika virus response measures](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13742-016-0146-1) (advanced)

# Data
Several sets of data will be available to hackathon participants during the event, as outlined at [http://www.hackathon.isid.org/resources](http://www.hackathon.isid.org/resources). 

In addition, participants will have the possibility to work with a selection of data resources related to the Zika outbreak, with a strong focus on [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), since data sharing is increasingly [recognized](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002109) as a key element of responses to both [infectious disease outbreaks](https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/sharing-data-during-zika-and-other-global-health-emergencies) and [climate change](https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/22/white-house-fight-climate-change-data-sharing/).

These resources will be outlined here in this repo in the weeks leading to the hackathon. A very rough draft is available via [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Medicine/Zika#Zika-related_data_sets](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Medicine/Zika#Zika-related_data_sets).

# Using and reusing data
Besides data, we welcome models, ontologies, analytical and visualization tools, apps and other approaches that can help make sense of the data or put it to new uses, with a focus on what can be done within the timeframe of the hackathon.
